2. **Status Flow**: pending → processing → successful/failed
3. **Retry Logic**: Max 3 retry attempts for failed payments
4. **Grace Period**: 30 days before policy lapses for non-payment
5. **Reconciliation**: Run daily to match expected vs received payments
6. **Audit Trail**: All changes logged in audit_events table
7. **Webhooks**: Netcash sends real-time payment status updates
